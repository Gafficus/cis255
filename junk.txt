This is a test of the git functionality and other shenanigans. I am editing the file junk.txt with Notepad++ connected
with SFTP on port 22 to the csis.svsu.edu machine using the NppFTP plugin.
The file will only be edited with Notepad++

After edits have been made:
git add --all
git commit -m "message text here"
git push
